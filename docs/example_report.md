## Financial Performance
American Airlines has faced significant financial challenges in recent years, driven primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on global air travel demand. After reporting a net profit of $27.6 billion in 2019, the company recorded massive losses in 2020 and 2021 as passenger volumes plummeted. 

In 2022, AAL's financial performance began to improve as travel demand recovered, with the company reporting a net loss of $9.3 billion for the full year. This represented a significant improvement from the prior two years, and the company returned to profitability in Q4 2022.

Key drivers of AAL's financial performance include:
- Passenger revenue, which declined sharply in 2020 but has been steadily recovering
- Cargo revenue, which has remained relatively strong throughout the pandemic
- Cost control measures, including fleet optimization, workforce reductions, and other operational efficiencies
